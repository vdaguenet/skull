Sound and typography
====================
A experiment about sound and typography for the HTML/CSS/JS class in [Gobelins, l'Ã©cole de l'image](http://www.gobelins.fr/) by [Jonathan Blanchet](http://jblanche.fr).

## Installation
After cloning the repository,
```
npm i
```
then, build the project
```
gulp
```

In a production environment,
```
gulp --env production
```
then copy / paste `index.html`, `assets/` and `build/` on your server.

## Browser support
For the best experience, use the latest version of Google Chrome. Otherwise, you can play it on a recent Firefox or Internet Explorer >= 11.

## Points to improve
- Improve performances.
- Do a more precise analyze of the sound.
